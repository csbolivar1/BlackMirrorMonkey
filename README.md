# MonkeyLovesYou

Based on Netflix series [Black Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror) episode [Black Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Museum_(Black_Mirror))

Inspired by part of the episode where a woman's consciousness is transferred to a toy monkey after she dies and her only forms of communication are two buttons:
* -A happy face that makes the monkey say "Monkey loves you"
* -A sad face that makes the monkey say "Monkey needs a hug"
